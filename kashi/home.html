Dedicated to the translation of Ichiko Aoba's work.
<br>
<br>
Firstly, I don't don't believe that translations of Aoba's work should be made. There is an incredible amount of poetry lost in conversion.
<br>
<br>
Her work is not something that anyone has the right to alter in her place, even if they can. 
<br>
<br>
Regardless, translations will be made over time.
<br>
<br>
Therefore, this page exists to ensure that Ichiko's every word and intention is treated with the utmost reverance.
<br>
<br>
Please don't paste these translations anywhere as they are highly subject to change. Please link to this main page instead.
