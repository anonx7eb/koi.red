Dedicated to the translation of Ichiko Aoba's work.
<br>
<br>
Firstly, we don't believe that translations of Aoba's work should be made.
<br>
<br>
It is not something that anyone has the right to alter in her place, even if they can.
<br>
<br>
However, we recognise that translations will invariably be made over time.
<br>
<br>
Therefore, we exist to make sure that her every word and intention is treated with the utmost reverance.
<br>
<br>
Please don't paste these translations anywhere as they are highly subject to change if this message still exists.
