<h2>blumepopo - apocalypsis (2020)</h2><hr>
<img src="apocalypsis.jpg">
<p>Blume popo is a five member indie rock band with shoegaze and math rock influences. In October of 2019 I came across their music video for <a href="https://youtu.be/92dhyVuIrJM">Veronica</a>; a mesmerizing mix of gazey guitars, passionate vocals, and contemporary dance. I must've watched it five times before coming back to reality. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4OvLUtskLYkOt1wx8CYvGX?si=Zqr8Z4sCREKUXZt_Des0nQ">Apocalypsis</a> follows in the same vein as their last EP <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7mqlBPVhjFt8AXgLCx4wzz?si=oBwW0KAPSoqQpjE2pL71ug">umi to dokuyaku</a>, but it doesn't quite have a <i>Veronica</i> of its own. Miko's vocals have tamed some but are still powerful in her signature, shouty, R-rolling way. They're one of the most exciting underground acts for me right now and I'd love to see a full-length from them some day.<br><br> 7/10 <br> </p>

  <p>I follow the Japanese music scene pretty extensively so this will serve as a place for me to write reviews and other related monologue.<br><br>I've compiled a list of my favorite songs/albums from 2019 that aren't fully region locked on Spotify. My <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/harkdand">lastfm profile</a> is a more complete list of my library if anyone cares.<br><br>The design of this site is a work in progress. The plan is to loosely theme it after Ichiko Aoba's pastel album covers. Check out the Ghost In The Shell OST song she did with Cornelius:<br><br>
