  <p>I've decided to create this blog as a new year's project where I will write about music. I follow the Japanese music scene pretty extensively so this will serve as a place for me to write reviews and other related monologue.<br><br>I've compiled a list of my favorite songs/albums from 2019 that aren't fully region locked on Spotify. My <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/harkdand">lastfm profile</a> is a more complete list of my library if anyone cares.<br><br>The design of this site is a work in progress. The plan is to loosely theme it after Ichiko Aoba's pastel album covers.<br>
