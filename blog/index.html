<p>Blume popo is a five member indie rock band with shoegaze and math rock elements. In October of 2019 I came across their music video for <a href="https://youtu.be/92dhyVuIrJM">Veronica</a>; a mesmerizing mix of gazey guitars, passionate vocals, and contemporary dance. I must've watched it five times before coming back to reality. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4OvLUtskLYkOt1wx8CYvGX?si=Zqr8Z4sCREKUXZt_Des0nQ">Apocalypsis</a> follows in the same vein as their last EP <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7mqlBPVhjFt8AXgLCx4wzz?si=oBwW0KAPSoqQpjE2pL71ug">umi to dokuyaku</a>, but it doesn't quite have a <i>Veronica</i> of its own. Miko's vocals have tamed some but are still powerful in her signature, shouty, R-rolling way. The first two tracks have math rock elements that aren't overdone. Blume popo is one of the most exciting underground acts for me right now and I'd love to see a full-length from them some day.<br><br> 7/10 <br> </p>

  <p>I follow the Japanese music scene pretty extensively so this will serve as a place for me to write reviews and other related monologue.<br><br>I've compiled a list of my favorite songs/albums from 2019 that aren't fully region locked on Spotify. My <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/harkdand">lastfm profile</a> is a more complete list of my library if anyone cares.<br><br>The design of this site is a work in progress. The plan is to loosely theme it after Ichiko Aoba's pastel album covers. I've been listening to the Ghost in The Shell OST song she did with Cornelius lately. Check it out below:<br><br>
